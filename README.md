# IntunePSUtils
Some PS Utils we've been creating/using for Intune
## License and Usage Rights
Although some of us work for Microsoft, **none** of these scripts created by us are a Microsoft product. We choose to release these scripts as MIT not only because we believe in Open Source, also to restrict any liability, waranty, or whatnot, for the use of all or any of these scripts. See the [License](https://github.com/CETSLATAM/IntunePSUtils/blob/main/LICENSE) for more details in the verbatim MIT license. 

# __Read and understand before run__ any of these scripts. 
This is not an official Microsoft repo, everything here comes from our own time and experience, but Microsoft (nor us by MIT license) can give you support, waranty, or assurances all of this will work. **Run to a subset of users/devices first** 

## General Usage
We try to have all the scripts documented, including requirements on the header of each script. If you find one that is not, hit us with a issue here in Github. Either way, __Read and understand before run__. We might be nice sharing those scripts, but I have a markdown guide open in my second monitor to write this, don't trust us too much. 

## Remediations (Previously Proactive Remediations)
In the Remediation folders, you'll find Detections and some remediations as we create them; All should follow the following naming conventions:

- [Topic] - [Detect|Remediation] - [Name/Version/AnyOther info].ps1

Please double check if you're using the correct pairs of Detection and Remediation, as unintended consecuences could and most likely arise from mismatching them.
