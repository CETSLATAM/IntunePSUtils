# IntunePSUtils
Some PS Utils we've been creating/using for Intune
## License and Usage Rights
Although some of us work for Microsoft, none of the scripts created by us are a Microsoft product. We choose to release these scripts as MIT not only because we believe in Open Source, also to restrict any liability for the use of all or any of these scripts. See the [License](https://github.com/CETSLATAM/IntunePSUtils/blob/main/LICENSE) for more details in the verbatim MIT license. 

## Usage
We try to have all the scripts documented, including requirements on the header of each script. If you find one that is not, hit us with a issue here in Github. Either way, __Read and understand before run__. We might be nice sharing those scripts, but I have a markdown guide open in my second monitor to write this, don't trust us too much.
